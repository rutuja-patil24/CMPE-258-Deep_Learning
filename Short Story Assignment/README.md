## 📄 Paper Summary

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of **Personalized Large Language Models (PLLMs)** — foundation models that generate responses tailored to individual users using data such as user profiles, historical dialogues, preferences, and behaviors.

### 🧩 Taxonomy Proposed:
The paper introduces a **three-level technical classification** of personalization techniques:

1. **Input-Level Personalization**: Prompt engineering using profiles, retrieval, or soft embeddings.
2. **Model-Level Personalization**: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) such as LoRA, IA3, and adapters.
3. **Objective-Level Personalization**: Preference alignment via reward modeling, RLHF, and multi-objective optimization.

### 🔍 Core Contributions:
- A structured taxonomy covering **60+ recent papers** on personalization
- Benchmarks and tools like **LaMP, REGEN, PEFT-U, and PersonalLLM**
- Insights into **challenges** such as privacy, user drift, long-term memory, and fairness
- A forward-looking roadmap covering **edge-device personalization**, **multimodal alignment**, and **federated learning**

> 📌 This work acts as a critical reference for building user-centric, adaptive, and trustworthy foundation models.
