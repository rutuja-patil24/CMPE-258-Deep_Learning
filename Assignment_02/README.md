## ðŸ“Š Deep Learning Assignment: Classification, Regression, and Image Classification
This repository contains three detailed Colab notebooks demonstrating deep learning models applied to classification, regression, and image classification tasks. Each notebook follows a structured approach with experiment tracking using Weights & Biases (W&B) and provides a complete set of artifacts and evaluation metrics.

### Classification Task: IMDB Sentiment Classification

This project builds a Bidirectional LSTM model to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative. The dataset is preprocessed using padding for uniform input size, and the model is trained for 5 epochs with real-time tracking in Weights & Biases (W&B). The final model achieves 83% accuracy on the test set. Performance evaluation includes a confusion matrix, ROC & PR curves, per-class metrics, and confidence-based error analysis. The project provides a complete deep learning pipeline for sentiment classification using TensorFlow and Keras.
